# Simple header-main-footer style sheet

This layout uses no framework and is built on pure modern css variables. It organizes a header on the top of a web page, a footer on the bottom and a main part in the middle. The main part take all space between header and footer. 

The layout dynamically sets up itself according with width and height of a screen. It can hide the footer or the header and the footer if the size of screen is too low.
